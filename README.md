Proposal for Origin Music
Client: Berin Akida
Company: Origin Music

Background
Origin Music, business concept inspired few years ago by a young man passionate about music, education and creativity. Initially just an idea, it has grown into a vision to make musical instruments and its services affordable to schools and individuals.

Purpose and vision
Origin Music is a music store offering a wide range of instruments, accessories, and services to music schools, self- learners, and musicians. It combines diversity, quality, and affordability to support music fans at all levels. Its main vision is to build an inspiring and nurturing community where every person feels comfortable to explore and grow confidently through music.

Website goals and objectives
The main goal of the Origin Music website is to establish the brand as a trusted and professional music store while showcasing its wide range of instruments, accessories, and services in an accessible way. The website also aims to attract and engage self-music learners, schools, and musicians through a user-friendly online space that reflects the brand’s vision.
To achieve these goals, the website will be designed to provide simple yet detailed information about products and services with intuitive navigation to make it easy for potential clients to explore. The website will consistently reflect the brand identity through the integration of its tagline, logo, and chosen colours, while also encouraging visitors to act, whether by requesting rentals, repairs, or purchasing accessories. Importantly, the website will also support direct online purchases with secure payments.

Website feature and functionalities
The website will include a index.html (homepage) introducing the brand and its services, an About Us page outlining its history, a Products page showcasing instruments and accessories, a Contact Us page to allow users to get in touch with the store for inquiries, feedback, or support and a Services page detailing rentals, repairs, maintenance, and school packages. Key functionality will feature product showcases with images and descriptions, clear navigation, design responsiveness, and consistent branding with the tagline “Where Music Begins”. 

Design and user experience
The design will be simple and user-friendly, reflecting creativity and professionalism.
•	Colour Scheme: A touch of black and gold for creativity, elegance and professionalism in the logo while staying client focused.
•	Typography: Clean, modern fonts.
•	Layout: Clear navigation and visual focus on products and services.
•	User Experience: Easy to navigate, responsive across devices, and aligned with brand identity.

Content Research and Sourcing 
To support the development of the Origin Music store website, the process of gathering information to create content combines original creation with free and openly licensed resources.
	Organisation's Website (if applicable): 
As Origin Music does not yet have an existing website, content will be created based on   the history of the store and its vision to make instruments affordable.
	Social media:
Although no real profiles exist, simulated examples of social media posts will be drafted to reflect how the brand might communicate online. For example:
•	“Exciting news! Origin Music now offers affordable rental packages for schools. #WhereMusicBegins”
•	“Meet our new collection of acoustic guitars - perfect for beginners and professionals alike.”
	Public domain: 
Free and reputable online resources were identified and will be used when needed:
•	Logo: customized Canva template; available at : https://www.canva.com/design/DAGxNySx9vs/UVSNXO3sDDUMzBsdmrL8gw/edit [ Accessed 24 September 2025]
•	Fonts: free and modern Google Fonts (e.g., Roboto, Open Sans) for typography, icons will be used.
•	Images: stock photos from Unsplash and Pexels (e.g., instruments, learners, and musical settings).
	Original content:
Several key elements were created specifically for this project:
•	Tagline: “Where Music Begins”
•	Product and service descriptions for instruments, accessories, rentals, and repairs.
•	Vision and mission statements for the About Us page.
•	Contact details and calls to action encouraging user engagement.
This approach ensures that the Origin Music website is supported by a realistic blend of original writing and openly licensed resources, while still respecting copyright and authenticity.

Technical requirements
The Origin Music website will require both a domain name and a reliable hosting service. A suitable option identified is originmusic. store, available through Hostinger for $47.88 for the first year and many other advantages - web hosting included (Hostinger, 2025). This domain is simple, brand-relevant, and easy for customers to remember. Hostinger also provides affordable hosting plans with sufficient storage for a small business, making it a practical choice for Origin Music’s initial online presence.
The website will be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a strong foundation for structure, design, and interactivity. 

Timeline and milestones
	Week 1 (27th August 2025): Uploading content and logo.
	Week 2 (27th August 2025): Develop site structure and upload content.
	Week 3 – 6 (29th September 2025):

	Week 6 - 9 (October 2025):
•	Conduct review and testing.

Budget
•	Domain registration: free for the first year when buying the premium web hosting, then $52 annually (Hostinger, 2025).
•	Premium web hosting: approximately $3.99 per month ($48 for the first year), (Hostinger, 2025).
