Proposal for Origin Music
Client: Berin Akida
Company: Origin Music

Background
Origin Music is small business concept inspired few years ago by a young man passionate about music, learning and creativity.
Initially just an idea, it has grown into a vision to make musical instruments and services affordable to schools and individuals.

Purpose and vision
Origin Music is a music store offering a wide range of instruments, accessories, and services to music schools, learners, and musicians; it combines creativity, quality, and affordability to support learners at all levels. Its main vision is to build an inspiring and nurturing community where every learner feels at ease to explore, play, and grow through music.
Website goals and objectives
The main goal of the Origin Music website is to establish the brand as a trusted and professional music store while showcasing its wide range of instruments, accessories, and services in an accessible way. The website also aims to attract and engage music learners, schools, and musicians by creating a user-friendly online space that reflects the brand’s vision of inspiring and nurturing a community where every learner feels at ease and gradually build a stronger online presence.
To achieve these goals, the website is designed to provide clear and detailed information about products and services, supported by visuals and simple navigation to ensure easy navigation of potential clients. The site will consistently reflect the brand identity through the integration of its tagline, logo, and chosen colours, while also encouraging visitors to act, whether by requesting rentals, repairs, or purchasing accessories. Importantly, the website will serve as a foundation for future growth by allowing potential addition of features such as online purchases, secure payments, or even learning resources to support music education.

Website feature and functionalities
The website will include a Home page introducing the brand and its services, an About Us page outlining its history, a Products page showcasing instruments
and accessories, a Contact Us page to allow users to get in touch with the store for inquiries, feedback, or support and a Services page detailing rentals,
repairs, maintenance, and school packages. Key functionality will feature product showcases with images and descriptions, contact forms, 
clear navigation, mobile responsiveness, and consistent branding with the tagline “Where Music Begins”. 

Design and user experience
The design will be simple and user-friendly, reflecting creativity and professionalism.
•	Colour Scheme: A touch of black and gold for creativity, elegance and professionalism in the logo while staying client focused.
•	Typography: Clean, modern fonts.
•	Layout: Clear navigation and visual focus on products and services.
•	User Experience: Easy to navigate, responsive across devices, and aligned with brand identity.

Technical requirements
The Origin Music website will require both a domain name and a reliable hosting service. A suitable option identified is originmusic. store, available through Hostinger for $47.88 for the first year and many other advantages - web hosting included (Hostinger, 2025). This domain is simple, brand-relevant, and easy for customers to remember. Hostinger also provides affordable hosting plans with sufficient storage for a small business, making it a practical choice for Origin Music’s initial online presence.
The website will be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a strong foundation for structure, design, and interactivity.

Timeline and milestones
•	Week 1: Finalise branding and logo.
•	Week 2–3: Develop site structure and upload content.
•	Week 4: Integrate visuals, forms, and responsive design.
•	Week 5: Conduct review and testing.
•	Week 6: Launch website and monitor performance.

Budget
•	Domain registration: free for the first year when buying the premium web hosting, then $52 annually (Hostinger, 2025).
•	Premium web hosting: approximately $3.99 per month ($48 for the first year), (Hostinger, 2025).
•	Business starter(email): approximately $0.39 per month ($4.68 for the first year), (Hostinger, 2025).
•	Development: self-developed for academic purposes (no external cost).
•	Maintenance: estimated at $50 per year for updates and support.
Total first-year cost: ±$102.68= ±R1848.24
Once this proposal is approved, the focus will move to finalizing the logo concept, tagline then building out the website structure. From there, Origin Music can begin supporting the growth of any musical talent, sharing products online and step by step attract more clients and grow its presence.
